    ### Roblox-Account-Gen
    ---
    A working roblox account generator (state 11.5.2021) it doesnt bypass the capcha stuff cuz these didnt showed up in my test runs
    i have no clue why i made this just had the idea out of no where

</p>

### Installation

git clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/TerrificTable/Roblox-Account-Gen`
install all requirements (if i upload a run.exe file it will install all requests automaticaly)`pip install colorama requests wget selenium`
and then just run the .py file i think i will upload the .py src and a compiled .exe file in the [releases](https://github.com/TerrificTable/Roblox-Account-Gen/releases)

## Features

It does what it says, it generates roblox accounts using threading so you can generate a lot of accounts and it will save the username and password in a login.txt file and will print the username password and date of birth in the console
